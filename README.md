## 📝 Description

An intelligent movie recommendation system that leverages both collaborative and content-based filtering to suggest personalized movie recommendations to users. The system analyzes user preferences, movie metadata, and viewing patterns to deliver tailored suggestions that match individual tastes.

## ✨ Features

- **Dual Filtering Approach**:
  - Collaborative Filtering: Connects users with similar movie preferences
  - Content-based Filtering: Analyzes movie attributes like genre, director, and plot

- **Advanced Data Processing**:
  - Text-to-numerical feature conversion
  - Genre and keyword distribution analysis
  - Director popularity metrics

- **Intelligent Recommendations**:
  - Cosine similarity-based matching
  - Personalized top-N movie suggestions
  - Genre-aware recommendations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning operations
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
